# odin-recipes
This project will put into practice all of the HTML knowledge I have been acquiring so far while working through the Foundations of The Odin Project. The goal is to build a basic recipe website.

This project will demonstrate my ability to make an index.html file filled with boilerplate HTML, use headings, paragraphs, unordered and ordered lists, links, and images. It will also test my terminal, git, and github knowledge, as all directories and files will be created in the terminal, and git version control will also be handled in the terminal.
